								Hi, I am Pavel, welcome to my website! I am an astrophysicist interested in galaxy formation and evolution.

								<a href="https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~kriek/">Mariska Kriek</a>, studying the dynamics of galaxies through cosmic time.
								In this section you can find some general information about me, and if you want to know more about my research please follow

								<b>Me:</b>
								<br> A few more personal things about myself in case you were curious...
								<br> I am from Mexico, and from the moment I was born and until I was six or so, I was one of the 
								&#126; 18000000 inhabitants of the marvelous, wonderful, and chaotic Mexico City. After than I grew up in 
								a beautiful city called
								<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=xalapa&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsa0ygA2RGuI8IED8uUpuO2PvLQ-uw:1665646639182&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiKsv-h2dz6AhUVH-wKHRfuAbEQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1440&bih=805&dpr=2.4">Xalapa</a>,
								where I did a BSc in Physics, although I returned to Mexico City to work on my BSc thesis at the Institute of Astronomy of 
								the National University of Mexico.
								<br>
								<br> After that, I came to the Netherlands, to pursuit a MSc degree in Astronomy at the University of
								Groningen. I liked Groningen so much that I stayed four more years for my PhD, which I obtained with 
								cum laude distinction in the summer of 2022. As of September of 2022 I moved to Leiden to hold a 
								postdoctoral position at Leiden Observatory.
								<br>
								<br> I love science but I enjoy many other things as well. What I love doing the most is reading (Paul Auster is my favorite writer), and I also 
								like a lot classical music, playing boardgames with friends, going to the cinema, as well as playing squash and basketball. Good food and nice wines 
								(especially Italian wines) are also a must in my life.

							My field of research is galaxy evolution. I am fascinated by the complexity and yet universality of the laws of physics 
							that shape galaxies, and I am committed to the challenging task of understanding them. In particular, I am interested 
							in how are the fundamental parameters of galaxies connected to each other, what are the main physical mechanisms 
							regulating galaxy evolution, and how is the link between the baryonic component of galaxies and their host dark matter haloes.
							<br>
							
							<br> My work is mostly observational (tho always trying to compare with simulations!), and I use some of the most advanced 
							facilities, namely optical and radio telescopes, often located in wonderful observatories. In the picture above you can see
								one of my favorite observatories, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Caracol,_Chichen_Itza">El Caracol</a>, 
								in the Mayan city of Chichén-Itzá. The observatory is not used anymore, but 
								I am very proud of coming from a country (Mexico) with such a rich astronomical heritage.

								<b>Ultra-diffuse galaxies</b><br>Ultra-diffuse galaxies have the stellar mass of dwarf galaxies but light distributions 
								similar to big spirals like the Milky Way, which makes them very diffuse. Their formation mechanisms (how do you form such an 
								extended light distribution with so little stellar mass) have been widely discussed in the literature over the last years but no concensus
								has been reached. I have tackled the question from an observational perspective.

								<b>Angular momentum in disc galaxies</b><br> Angular momentum is one of the most important parameters regulating galaxy evolution 
								through cosmic time, and it is tightly liked with galaxy morphology, star formation levels, and gas content.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>The scaleheights of gas discs</b><br>While the gas discs of late-type galaxies are often assumed to be thin, in reality they are thick, 
								and with a scaleheight that increases as a function of radius, i.e. the discs are flared.
