								<b>Me:</b>
								<br> A few more personal things about myself in case you were curious...
								<br> I am from Mexico, and from the moment I was born and until I was six or so, I was one of the 
								&#126; 18000000 inhabitants of the marvelous, wonderful, and chaotic Mexico City. After than I grew up in 
								a beautiful city called
								<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=xalapa&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsa0ygA2RGuI8IED8uUpuO2PvLQ-uw:1665646639182&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiKsv-h2dz6AhUVH-wKHRfuAbEQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1440&bih=805&dpr=2.4">Xalapa</a>,
								where I did a BSc in Physics, although I returned to Mexico City to work on my BSc thesis at the Institute of Astronomy of 
								the National University of Mexico.
								<br>
								<br> After that, I came to the Netherlands (lovely weather, amazing good, why not), to pursuit a MSc degree in Astronomy at the University of
								Groningen. I liked Groningen so much (er gaat niets boven Groningen!) that I stayed four more years for my PhD, which I obtained with 
								cum laude distinction in the summer of 2022. As of September of 2022 I moved to Leiden to hold a 
								postdoctoral position at Leiden Observatory.
								<br>
								<br> I love science but I enjoy many other things as well. What I love doing the most is reading (Paul Auster is my favorite writer, 
								The Tin Drum arguably my favorite book, but you know one cannot just say what is their favorite book without feeling remorse for the others), 
								and I also like a lot classical music (nothing like Tchaikovsky's violin concert), playing boardgames with friends (and ideally, but 
								not necesairly remaining friends), going to the cinema (even better if it's a Hugh Grant's movie), as well as playing squash and basketball 
								(go Spurs go!). Good food and nice wines (especially Italian wines, like a good Sangiovese) are also a must in my life.

							My field of research is galaxy evolution. I am fascinated by the complexity and yet universality of the laws of physics 
							that shape galaxies, and I am committed to the challenging task of understanding them. In particular, I am interested 
							in how are the fundamental parameters of galaxies connected to each other, what are the main physical mechanisms 
							regulating galaxy evolution, and how is the link between the baryonic component of galaxies and their host dark matter haloes.
							<br>
							
							<br> My work is mostly observational (tho always trying to compare with simulations!), and I use some of the most advanced 
							facilities, namely optical and radio telescopes, often located in wonderful observatories. In the picture above you can see
								one of my favorite observatories, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Caracol,_Chichen_Itza">El Caracol</a>, 
								in the Mayan city of Chichén-Itzá. The observatory is not used anymore, but 
								I am very proud of coming from a country (Mexico) with such a rich astronomical heritage.

								<b>Ultra-diffuse galaxies</b><br>Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have the stellar mass of dwarf galaxies but light distributions 
								similar to big spirals like the Milky Way, which makes them very diffuse. Their formation mechanisms (how do you form such an 
								extended light distribution with so little stellar mass) have been widely discussed in the literature over the last years but no concensus
								has been reached. I have tackled the question from an observational perspective, looking both at the photometrical 
								properties of UDGs in nearby galaxy clusters, and especially at the gas dynamics of isolated UDGs. 
								<br>
								<br> One of the main findings of my research is that gas-rich UDGs (see left panel in the figure below) deviate from the baryonic 
								Tully-Fisher relation (see right panel), being this the first known galaxy population to do so. The position in the relation suggests that 
								the galaxies have baryon fractions approaching the cosmological limit. Our kinematic observations have also unvailed that gas-rich UDGs seem 
								to have dark matter haloes with inner densities much lower than expected in CDM.

								<b>Angular momentum in disc galaxies</b><br> From very early models of galaxy formation it became clear that 
								together with the mass, angular momentum is a fundamental parameter regulating galaxy evolution. For example, the existence of the 
								Fall relation (see image below) shows clearly the tight link between mass (M), specific angular momentum (j) and morphology.
							</p>
							
							<center>

								the so-called Fall relation), and galaxy morphology. Credits: Luca Cortese.

							</figcaption>
							</figure> 
								</center>
								
							<p>
								<br> Together with my collaborators, I have been studying the angular momentum in nearby disc galaxies, obtanining some of 
								the most detailed measurements of their stellar, gas, and baryonic specific angular momentum. As shown below, we have characterised 
								the j-M relations across a wide range of mass, with the largest high-quality sample available in the literature 
								(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...647A..76M/abstract">see Mancera Pi&#241;a et al. 2021a</a>). Moreover, we have 
								discovered one of the tightest known scaling relation for disc galaxies, connecting their baryonic mass, baryonic specific angular 
								momentum, and the gas fraction of galaxies (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...651L..15M/abstract">see Mancera Pi&#241;a et al. 2021a</a>). 
								This is quite remarkable given the large number of processes that can affect the angular 
								momentum reservoir of galaxies, such as feedback, different gas accretion histories, mergers, or dynamical friction, and yet it all results
								in a very tight scaling relation. Our observations provide clear observational tests for models and simulations aiminng to reproduce 
								realistic galaxies.

								<b>The scaleheights of gas discs</b><br>While the gas discs of late-type galaxies are often assumed to be thin, observations in edge-on 
								galaxies show that the discs are actually thick, with a scaleheight that increases as a function of radius, i.e. the discs are flared. 
								This flaring is a direct consequence of the balance between gas pressure and gravity (see sketch below), and we can use the equations of vertical hydrostatic 
								equilibrium to estimate the flaring in any galaxy.

								</i>  </p> </center>
							</figcaption>
							</figure> 
							</center> 
							<br> During my research, I have designed a method to estimate the flaring of nearby disc galaxies (based on the equations of vetical
							hydrostatic equilibrium) while simultenously deriving their mass model based on rotation curve decomposition. This has allowed me to 
							obtain some of the most detailed scale heights and mass models of massive and dwarf late-type galaxies, as shown in 
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.3329M/abstract">Mancera Pi&#241;a et al. 2022b</a>. These mass 
							models are also an excellent tool to test different models of galaxy evolution, as they provide clear constraints on the parameters
							of the dark matter haloes of our galaxy sample.
