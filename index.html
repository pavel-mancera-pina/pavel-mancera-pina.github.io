								Hi, I am Pavel, welcome to my website! I am an astrophysicist interested in galaxy formation and evolution. 
								I am fascinated by the complexity and yet universality of the laws of physics that shape galaxies, 
								and I am committed to the challenging task of understanding them. In particular, I am interested in how are 
								the fundamental parameters of galaxies connected to each other, what are the main physical mechanisms regulating 
								galaxy evolution, and how is the link between the baryonic component of galaxies and their host dark matter haloes.
								<br> Currently, I told a postdoctoral position at Leiden Observatory within the group of 
								<a href="https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~kriek/">Mariska Kriek</a>, studying the dynamics of galaxies through cosmic time.

								<b>Education:</b>
							<br> &#8211; 2018-2022: <b> PhD (cum laude) in Astrophysics at the University of Groningen</b>. 
							Thesis: "Dark matter and angular momentum in nearby disc galaxies".
							Advisors: <a href="https://www.filippofraternali.com/">Filippo Fraternali</a>, Tom Ooosterloo, Betsey Adams.

								<b>Research Interests:</b> 
								<br>I have very broad interests in galaxy formation and evolution. 
								My expertise is on the kinematics and dynamics of galaxies (especially discs), but in general
								I am very interested in the processes regulating the baryon cycle of galaxies and the connection
								between the observed properties of galaxies and the theoretical expectations for their host dark matter haloes.
