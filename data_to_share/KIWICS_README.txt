This is a fits table with the photometric catalogue for all the UDGs in the eight nearby KIWICS clusters studied in 
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.1036M/abstract and https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481.4381M/abstract.
Please see the papers for details.

The columns are as follows:
1) RA
2) DEC
3) Non-circularized effective radius in kpc
4) mean effective surface brightness in the r band
5) SÃ©rsic index
6) axis ratio
7) total aperture magnitude in r
8) magnitude inside Re
9) color (g-r)
10) color using the effective aperture
11) uncertainty in 3)
12) uncertainty in 4)
13) uncertainty in 5)
14) uncertainty in 6)
15) uncertainty in 8)
16) uncertainty in 10)
